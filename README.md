# Blurring Faces

Using OpenCv to blur faces in images, videos, and my webcam.  Okay Okay, this is not actually machine learning but OpenCV is that girl in Computer Vision so 
why not find some faces and blur them?

* **ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways**
   * Using mediapipe to face detection to find faces.
    * As you can see in the header image, a face that is slightly tilted will not be found but most of the faces where found.
    * FaceDetection did a much better job in the webcam and video.
    * It didn't really handle multiple faces in videos well.
   * I can be here all day messing with blurs and color spaces but I have to move on with my life.
   * It's a demo not perfect, I am away putting your hand in front of your face removes the blur.
